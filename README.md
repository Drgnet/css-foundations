CSS foundations 01-05

This repo was started for the first lesson of the CSS course.
It is almost midnight right now, and I am having a hard time staying
awake, so I am going to go to bed, but tomorrow I plan on going back
over the intro on the train, and then looking over the lessons on 
github to see what is in store for me!

I just finished all the assignments in the lesson. Wasn't too bad. slow
but sped up pretty after the second lesson. I practiced the Pomodoro timer
and it seemed to work out pretty well for me. Everything stuck pretty well
I feel. I should call it for the night, It's almost 11pm, but I really
feel like putting in a bit more time.

I do think I'm getting to the end of my brain power for the night though.
My eyes are starting to get tired! Dang, this has been such a fun time. I
have really enjoyed learning how to use Git, and Github. the syntax of 
html, and CSS are coming pretty easy to me I feel. I'm not really struggl-
ing to comprehend anyting too much. I'm hoping that flows well into Java 
and then well into Python. I am so excited to keep this going!!! Wish me
luck everyone, this seems to be sticking.
