CSS foundations 01-05

This repo was started for the first lesson of the CSS course.
It is almost midnight right now, and I am having a hard time staying
awake, so I am going to go to bed, but tomorrow I plan on going back
over the intro on the train, and then looking over the lessons on 
github to see what is in store for me!
